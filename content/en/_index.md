## About Qiaotong

Qiaotong is a general finite element analysis software for bridges, independently developed by **China Railway Major Bridge Reconnaissance & Design Institute Co., Ltd.** (BRDI). Inspired by the spirit of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which turned a natural barrier into a thoroughfare, we are committed to providing a comprehensive and high-performance solution. It is suitable for the structural analysis of any bridge type throughout its entire lifecycleâ€”from design and construction to operationâ€”and supports industry standards for highways, railways, and municipalities. Qiaotong is widely used in design, construction, and research institutions. Its core calculation engine has been rigorously tested and refined over decades through hundreds of bridge projects, ensuring accurate and reliable results.

Developed for the Windows environment, the software integrates an advanced interactive modeling interface, a powerful 3D graphics engine, a dynamic two-way interactive 2D graphics engine, efficient database access technology, outstanding solving performance, and comprehensive post-processing modules. Crafted by a team of engineers who deeply understand frontline needs, its user interface is designed to be familiar to users of mainstream commercial software, enabling a zero-cost learning curve and seamless data exchange, which significantly enhances work efficiency.
